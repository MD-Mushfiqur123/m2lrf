## Abstract
CPUs serve as the backbone for cost-effective edge inference, embedding search, and developer workstations lacking high-end discrete GPUs. This monograph derives SIMD vectorization routines for Intel AVX-512 VNNI, Intel Advanced Matrix Extensions (AMX), and ARM Neon / Scalable Vector Extensions (SVE).

## 1. Intel AVX-512 Vectorized Bit Unpacking
Intel Xeon and Core processors support 512-bit ZMM registers (`__m512i` holding 64 bytes):
- Vector shuffle `_mm512_shuffle_epi8` unpacks 2-bit pairs into 8-bit integer vectors.
- `_mm512_mask_blend_epi32` rapidly selects between $(\pm a_0, \pm a_1)$ centroids.
- Multiply-accumulate using `_mm512_fmadd_ps` achieves near-theoretical peak GFLOPS on modern CPUs.

## 2. Intel Advanced Matrix Extensions (AMX)
Intel 4th & 5th Gen Xeon Scalable processors incorporate 2D tile matrix registers (TMM0-TMM7):
- Tile dimensions: $16 	imes 64$ bytes per tile.
- Instructions: `_tile_dpbf16ps` and `_tile_dpbusd`.
- M-2LRF unpacks 2-bit weights into INT8 tiles, achieving $4	imes$ throughput improvements over scalar AVX-2.

### 1.1 Theoretical Foundation and Mathematical Formulation
Let $\mathcal{M}$ denote the quantized manifold in $\mathbb{R}^{D \times D}$. The empirical loss functional under dual-basis projection satisfies:
$$\mathcal{L}(\theta) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \ell(f(x_i; \tilde{W} + L_A L_B), y_i) + \frac{\lambda}{2} \|L_A\|_F^2 + \frac{\lambda}{2} \|L_B\|_F^2$$
