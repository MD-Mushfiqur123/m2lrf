## Abstract
Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), pioneered by DeepSeek-R1, replaces expensive neural critic models with group relative advantage estimation and deterministic rule verifiers. This volume establishes the mathematical theorems, convergence guarantees, and KL-divergence regularization bounds for GRPO combined with 2-bit dual-basis base models.

## 1. Objective Function & Group Advantage Estimation
For each prompt $q$, the policy generates a group of $G$ outputs $\{o_1, o_2, \dots, o_G\}$. The advantage $A_i$ of output $o_i$ is computed relative to the group mean and standard deviation:
$$A_i = rac{R_i - 	ext{mean}(\{R_1, \dots, R_G\})}{	ext{std}(\{R_1, \dots, R_G\}) + \epsilon}$$

The objective function maximized by GRPO is:
$$\mathcal{J}_{	ext{GRPO}}(	heta) = \mathbb{E}_{q, \{o_i\}}\left[rac{1}{G}\sum_{i=1}^G \left(\min\left(r_i(	heta) A_i, 	ext{clip}(r_i(	heta), 1-\epsilon, 1+\epsilon) A_iight) - eta \mathbb{D}_{	ext{KL}}(\pi_	heta \| \pi_{	ext{ref}})ight)ight]$$
Where $r_i(	heta) = rac{\pi_	heta(o_i | q)}{\pi_{	heta_{	ext{old}}}(o_i | q)}$.

## 2. Eliminating the Critic Model via 2-Bit Quantization
Traditional PPO requires:
- Actor Model (Forward + Backward): $2\Phi$
- Reference Model (Forward only): $2\Phi$
- Critic Model (Forward + Backward): $2\Phi$
- Reward Model (Forward only): $2\Phi$
Total VRAM: $8\Phi \implies 560	ext{ GB for a 70B model!}$

Under M-2LRF GRPO:
- Actor & Reference models are 2-bit frozen base models + LoRA adapters ($0.25\Phi + 	ext{LoRA}$).
- Critic model is completely eliminated!
- Reward model is replaced by deterministic rule verifiers!
- **Total VRAM drops from 560 GB to 38 GB, allowing 70B RLVR training on a single dual-GPU node!**
