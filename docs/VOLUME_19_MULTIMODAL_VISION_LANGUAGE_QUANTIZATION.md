## Abstract
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) combine pre-trained visual encoders (e.g. SigLIP, CLIP) with language decoder backbones via cross-attention or multi-modal projection MLP layers. This volume formulates joint 2-bit quantization for vision encoders, projection tokens, and language backbones.

## 1. Visual Token Density & Projection Dynamics
Visual representations exhibit distinct spectral characteristics from text tokens:
- Vision encoder features have higher Kurtosis ($\kappa > 90$) due to spatial background redundancy.
- Applying 2D Fast Walsh-Hadamard Transform (FWHT) across the visual patch grid reduces kurtosis to Gaussian levels ($\kappa < 0.5$).
- Projector MLP weights $(W_{	ext{proj}, 1}, W_{	ext{proj}, 2})$ are quantized to 2.6 bpp mixed precision, preserving fine-grained OCR and spatial bounding box detection.
